# Post Hook API Testing



The API Testing Post HOOK project is a robust framework designed to facilitate the testing of RESTful APIs through a series of automated test cases. Utilizing the REST Assured library, this project covers various HTTP methods, including GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. Each test case validates the functionality of the API endpoints and ensures they behave as expected.

Key features of this framework include:

Comprehensive Testing: It encompasses all major HTTP methods, enabling thorough testing of API interactions.
Detailed Logging: Test results are logged into files, providing a clear record of each test execution and its outcomes.
Extent Reporting: The framework generates detailed Extent Reports, offering insights into test performance and results for easy analysis.
Designed for ease of use, this framework allows developers and testers to validate API functionalities efficiently while maintaining clear documentation and reporting for every test run.
